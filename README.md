### A Note on IDEs

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) isn't strictly necessary, but can make your life signifcantly easier.

* Dependency management
* Code completion
* Syntax hightlighting
* Debugging tools

### Brackets

[Adobe Brackets](http://brackets.io/) seems pretty cool, I'll check it out.

### VS Code

[Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has evolved into the *de facto* IDE for several languages. Support for the Javascript ecosystem is particularly strong

### Git Version Control

Save yourself the nightmare of hundreds of folders with names like `final portfolio test v3 (final)`. Is it essential? No. Will it make your life easier? Yes, if you knock a cup of tea over your laptop and loose 3 weeks of work.

## Twitter Bootstrap

[TWB](https://getbootstrap.com/) is the most well established front-end framework in an ever increasing herd.
